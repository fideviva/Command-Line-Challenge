## Why I love markdown
I really enjoyed learning about markdown so I can make the readme files for my **future projects!** how awesome!

### More about Markdowng
I can write in *Italics* or in **bold**, or ***both***.
As my father once said once:
>Do as you do and you'll do best!
>>Actually my mothe told me not to follow this advice

> My mother advice was actually based on this three principles:
> - Work Hard
> - be humble
> - love what you do
> just remember everything is going according to the **plan**

#### Even a little more about mark down
1. No need to fear it
2. practice it until I am a master
3. applied it on my projects
4. applied on my work
    1. if i find a job
    2. if i dont find a job than just up to point 3
